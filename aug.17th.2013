I am back on github, I am pround to say that I am alive again. This is a long absent from my last login. Whether or not I am going to stay depends on a lot of things.
I am living on my own now, that's why I have to care more about more things I had ever thought about. This is no game, and I should not ask for anyone's help.
Today I bought a Dell monitor and I felt like being humilated by the seller. The reason is quite simple, I am poor and I am doing something stupid. I had been bargaining all the time without realizing that I was not respecting the seller's work. That is not good for both of us.
I have to do more to compensate for those chances I had lost. I need respect and more respect. I will fight for my will.
I will do that.
