practice
========

practice on github.

simply writing on github is of great joy.
somebody may just joining me on writing online.
i may change this to be a good platform to share my thoughts via words and letters rather than codes.
i will use this tool to type my everyday logs.
i really love the idea of capturing everything related to the evolution of our thoughts.
so git is good for this.
i can review and modify everything and all those process can be just recorded.
that will be of great joy.
so i am going to use a private repository for this purpose.
