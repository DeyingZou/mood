I am writing agqin. After a week since last talk to myself. I have been thinking about what I am doing and how I can get rid of the sad feeling of being lonely and not understood. I am so tired of this type of life.
I have been trying to contact some of the girls I know. They seemed to be tired of my deeds, too. I had better cut off the relation-ship, especially those unnecessary thoughts.
I am trying out a new change on myself. I wanna make myself more mature. I will keep my pace slow, hold the breathe down, live the life simple.
I am trying, I want to prove myself.
